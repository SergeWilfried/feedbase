## Environment Variables

Now that Supabase is set up and running, we need to add all necessary environment variables to our project. These variables will be used to connect to our Supabase database and to authenticate users.

### Supabase

To retrieve the Supabase variables, we can run the following command in our terminal:

```bash
supabase status
```

<Note>Supabase must be running in order for this command to work.</Note>

This will return a list of urls and keys that we will need to add to our project. We will need to add the following variables to our `.env` file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL= # API URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY= # anon key
```

### Github OAuth

For authentication, locally we will be using GitHub. To set this up, we will need to create a GitHub OAuth app. To do this, go to your GitHub settings and click on "Developer Settings" in the sidebar. Then click on "OAuth Apps" and "New OAuth App". Fill out the form with the following information:

- Application Name: `Localhost`
- Homepage URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Authorization callback URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`

Once you have created the app, you will be given a Client ID and Client Secret. Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID= # client id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET= # client secret
```

### Resend

<Info>This is optional. If you do not want to use email verification, you can skip this step.</Info>

To send emails, we will be using [Resend](https://resend.com/). Create an account and add your API key to your `.env` file:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY= # api key
```

### Other

We will also need to add one other variables to our `.env` file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN= # root domain (e.g. localhost:3000)
```

## Next Steps

Now that we have our environment variables set up, we are ready to start the development server and begin building.

```bash
pnpm dev
```
