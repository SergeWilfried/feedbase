## System Requirements

- [Node.js 18.0.0](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or higher
- [pnpm 8.8.0](https://pnpm.io/installation) or higher

## Database Setup
Luminar uses [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) as its database. You can create a free account and use the free tier for development. Once you have created an account, you can create a new project and use the following commands to set up the database for local development.

```bash
# Install the supabase CLI
pnpm install -g supabase-cli

# Create a new database
supabase init

# Start the database
supabase start
```

Once the database is running, you can visit [http://localhost:54321](http://localhost:54321) to view the Supabase dashboard and run the [migration script](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/database/migrations) to populate the database with the necessary tables.

1. Clone the repository and open the project directory
